# PhotoCrowd
A native iOS application powered by Flickr's API

## Details
PhotoCrowd is a photo viewing app in which users can browse endless photos from Flickr from either the most recent photos uploaded to Flickr, or searching by tag.

Any post can also be more closely viewed by tapping on the post. Relevant information to the post will be displayed as well as comments of the post if any.

A user can also add a comment or add the post to their favorites if they log into Flickr or create a Flickr account.
